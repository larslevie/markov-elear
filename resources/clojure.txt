Clojure is a dialect of the Lisp programming language created by Rich Hickey. Clojure is a general-purpose programming language with an emphasis on functional programming. It runs on the Java virtual machine, Common Language Runtime, and JavaScript engines. Like other Lisps, Clojure treats code as data and has a macro system. The current development process is community-driven, overseen by Rich Hickey as its benevolent dictator for life (BDFL).

Clojure encourages immutability and immutable data structures. While its type system is entirely dynamic, recent efforts have also sought the implementation of gradual typing. Clojure encourages programmers to be explicit about managing state and identity. This focus on programming with immutable values and explicit progression-of-time constructs are intended to facilitate developing more robust programs, especially multithreaded ones.

Clojure is successfully used in industry by firms such as Walmart, Puppet Labs, and other large software firms. Commercial support for Clojure is provided by Cognitect. Annual Clojure conferences are organised every year across the globe.

The latest stable version of Clojure is 1.8, released on January 19, 2016. The first stable release was version 1.0, released on May 4, 2009. Clojure is free software released under the Eclipse Public License.
